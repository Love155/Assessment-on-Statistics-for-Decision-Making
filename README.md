## Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### Loading the dataset and displaying data overview: types, non-null counts, summary statistics, and missing values.
#### Data Visualization:
- Heatmaps for missing values.
- Histograms for both categorical and numerical variables.
- Box plots for numeric features.
- Correlation matrix for analyzing relationships between numeric features.
## Step 2: Hypothesis Testing and Probability Calculations
